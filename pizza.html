<h2>Method</h2>
<p>Making the Pizza Dough
    Proof the yeast:
    Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.</p>

<p>After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is still active and alive.</p>
<p>
    (Note that if you are using "instant yeast" instead of "active yeast", no proofing is required. Just add to the flour in the next step.)</p>
<p>
    Mixing a pizza dough recipe in the bowl of a stand mixer.
    Make and knead the pizza dough:
    Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.</p>

<p>Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.</p>

<p>If you don't have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by hand.</p>

<p>The dough should be a little sticky, or tacky to the touch. If it's too wet, sprinkle in a little more flour.</p>

    <li>
        Let the dough rise:
        Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil.</li>
    <li>At this point you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise. A slow fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will result in more complex flavors in the dough. A quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours in a warm place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work with.</li>
    <li>Cover the dough with plastic wrap.</li>
